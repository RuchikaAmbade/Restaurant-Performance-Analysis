# Restaurant Performance Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to uncover trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing ratings. It involves preprocessing, statistical exploration, visualization, and modelingâ€”all done using Python and its powerful data science libraries.

# Objectives
Explore and clean real-world restaurant data

Perform statistical and geospatial analysis

Engineer features for deeper insight

Build predictive models for restaurant ratings

Visualize findings using Python libraries

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn (for modeling)

Plotly / Folium (for interactive visualizations, if used)

 # Tasks Completed

# Level 1: Basic Exploration & Analysis
Identified missing values and handled data types

Explored categorical distributions (e.g., cuisines, country)

Mapped restaurant locations using coordinates

# Level 2: Advanced Feature Insights
Analyzed table booking and online delivery trends

Explored price ranges and their correlation with ratings

Created new variables using feature engineering

# Level 3: Predictive Modeling & Visualization
Built regression models to predict aggregate ratings

Analyzed customer preferences by cuisine

Created visualizations to support analytical insights
